# E2E Test Runner

The e2e test runner leverages kubetest to execute e2e tests and has a few additional features:

- Define description files consisting of e2e testcases to run
- Annotate testcases to run only for dedicated cloud providers
- Evaluate test results of the kubetest run and provide elastic search documents

## Usage

Ensure all required environment variables have been set. Create a `shoot.config` file in `EXPORT_PATH` directory and paste the kubeconfig of the kubernetes cluster to test in it. Run `e2etest` in command line to execute the e2e tests.

### Prerequisites:

- Go installed
- Git installed
- (only for publishing results) environment variable `GCLOUD_ACCOUNT_SECRET` should point to a google cloud storage secret file

### Parameters:

| Env Var  | Cmd Line | Default | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| K8S_VERSION | k8sVersion |  | **[Required]** Kubernetes cluster version |
| TESTCASE_GROUPS | testcasegroup |  | **[Required]** testcases groups to run (comma separated). E.g. `fast,slow` |
| CLOUDPROVIDER | cloudprovider |  | **[Required]** Cloud provider (supported: aws, gcp, azure, alicloud, openstack) |
| DESCRIPTION_FILE |  | working.json | Path to description json file, which lists the testcases to run |
| E2E_EXPORT_PATH  |  | /tmp/e2e/export  | Location of `shoot.config` file and test results |
| GINKGO_PARALLEL |  | true | Whether to run kubetest in parallel way. Testcases that consist of the `[Serial] tag are executed serially. |
| IGNORE_FALSE_POSITIVE_LIST |  | false | Ignores exclusion of testcases that are listed in `false_positive.json` |
| IGNORE_SKIP_LIST |  | false | Ignores exclusion of testcases that are listed in `skip.json`  |
| INCLUDE_UNTRACKED_TESTS |  | false | Executes testcases that are not mentioned in description files for given provider and kubernetes release version |
| FLAKE_ATTEMPTS | flakeAttemps | 2 | Flake attempts for kubetest: how many time a failed test should be rerun |
| PUBLISH_RESULTS_TO_TESTGRID |  | false | Whether to push test results to google cloud storage, for testgrid |
| RETEST_FLAGGED_ONLY |  | false | Runs testcases with retest flag only. Value of `DESCRIPTION_FILE` is ignored |
| E2E_KUBECONFIG_PATH | kubeconfig | $E2E_EXPORT_PATH/shoot.config | File path of kubeconfig file |
| - | debug | false | Runs application in debug mode |

### Description Files
Example:
```json
[
  { "testcase": "[k8s.io] Sysctls [NodeFeature:Sysctls] should reject invalid sysctls", "groups": ["slow", "conformance"], "only": ["aws", "gcp"], "retest": ["aws"], "comment": "Some comment"},
  { "testcase": "[k8s.io] Sysctls [NodeFeature:Sysctls] should support sysctls", "groups": ["slow"], "exclude": ["aws"]}
]
```
| Field  | Description  |
|---|---|
| testcase | testcase name. Can be a substring. All testcases that has this as substring will be executed |
| groups | assigns the testcase to testcase groups |
| only | will consider the testcase only for given cloud provider |
| exclude | will not consider the tetscase for given cloud provider |
| comment | is not evaluated in any way in code. Use only for additional information |
| retest | testcase will be excluded from all general test runs for given providers. Testcases with retest flag can be executed by setting `RETEST_ONLY=true`  |

Existing description files:
- `working.json` consists of all working e2e testcases separated in different groups
- `skip.json` consists of testcases that are always skipped by kubetest due to reasons like: driver not supported, requires >1 nodes, etc.
- `false_positive.json` consists of testcases that are failing because of different reasons like bad code, which makes sense to test with next kubernetes release version

### Output
You find the kubetest dump results (like e2e.log and junit_*.xml files) in the `/tmp/e2e/artifacts` directory. These artifacts are evaluated and stored as *.json files in the `EXPORT_PATH` directory.
